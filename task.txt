Please complete this exercise and either provide us a zip file of the project or post it on a public repository such as github.


- Set up the application to use ui-router (npm install angular-ui-router) to provider 2+ routes (views/pages).

- Have each route use a dedicated view file and controller to bind data to the view file.

- Create at least one controller call a service to retrieve and pass back data from a REST endpoint. (use this sample endpoint: http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1)

- Display data from the endpoint on the view

  - Create a list view with links to a view that shows individual records

  - The individual record view should allow for the ability to edit that information in a form and send it back to an endpoint with some basic client validation.

- Use gulp to build the project into a dist with a single JS minified source file for your own source, and a separate JS file containing the angular and other libraries used by your project.
